Board bring up and application development LEDs, SERCOM0 [UART], I2C Scanner, I2C Read, SPI, GUI implementation. This project is based on the Microchip ATSAMD51J20A microcontroller, a high-performance ARM Cortex-M4F MCU running up to 120â€¯MHz with a floating-point unit (FPU).
It is part of the SAM D5/E5 family, optimized for real-time applications, data acquisition, communication interfaces, and IoT development.
The ATSAMD51J20A provides a powerful combination of performance, low power consumption, and rich peripheral support. 
This ZIP file contains the board bring-up files as well as a GUI-based application to control various peripherals such as LEDs, I2C, and SPI devices.

**GUI Application Features:**

**LED Control:** Click the LED button to turn the LED ON. 
**I2C Sensor Read:** Click the I2C button to read data from the connected sensor. 
**SPI Sensor Read:** Click the SPI button to read data from the connected SPI device.
